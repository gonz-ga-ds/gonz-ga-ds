    <a href="https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/Project2_Gonzalez_Lu_Desai">Exploring Difficulty Voting in the 2020 Election</a>
    <p>This was a 3-person project where we did exploratory data analysis, t-test formulation, graphs and a final report that analyzed the following question: Did Democratic voters or Republican voters experience more difficulty voting in the 2020 election? The report was produced using the RStudio IDE and R Markdown file format.</p>
