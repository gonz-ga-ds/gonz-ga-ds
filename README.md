<h1>Hi, I'm Jerry Gonzalez!</h1>
<p><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/gerardoagonzalez">Data scientist and hardware/systems engineer</a></p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a bilingual, multifaceted data scientist with a background in machine learning, data science, and process improvements. I leverage strong analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills to manage projects, create interactive reports, visualizations, and deliver actionable insights that add value to organizations and clients. I excel in quickly grasping and implementing new concepts and tools, improving operational efficiency, and boosting profitability. I thrive both independently and as part of a team in dynamic environments.</p>
<p>Currently, I am a MIDS student at the UC Berkeley School of Information, expecting to graduate in Spring 2024.</p>

<h3>Research methods and statistical techniques</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/Project2_Gonzalez_Lu_Desai">Exploring Difficulty Voting in the 2020 Election</a></strong><br>
In this three-person project, we performed exploratory data analysis, formulated t-tests, and created visualizations to explore whether Democratic or Republican voters experienced more difficulties voting in the 2020 election. This report was generated using RStudio and R Markdown.</p>

<h3>Machine learning project</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/mids-207-final-project-summer23-Nick-Frances-Jerry-Chi">Distinguish Emergency Vehicles in Traffic</a></strong><br>
In this four-person project, we applied machine learning techniques to distinguish emergency vehicle sirens from regular road noise to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion.</p>
