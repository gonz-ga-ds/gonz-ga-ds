## About me
I am a bilingual, multifaceted data scientist with a background in machine learning, data science, and process improvements. I leverage strong analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills to manage projects, create interactive reports, visualizations, and deliver actionable insights that add value to organizations and clients. I excel in quickly grasping and implementing new concepts and tools, improving operational efficiency, and boosting profitability. I thrive both independently and as part of a team in dynamic environments.

Currently, I am a MIDS student at the UC Berkeley School of Information, expecting to graduate in Spring 2024.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Data Science Projects

### Research methods and statistical techniques
**[Exploring Difficulty Voting in the 2020 Election](https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/Project2_Gonzalez_Lu_Desai)**  
In this three-person project, we performed exploratory data analysis, formulated t-tests, and created visualizations to explore whether Democratic or Republican voters experienced more difficulties voting in the 2020 election. This report was generated using RStudio and R Markdown.

### Machine learning project
**[Distinguish Emergency Vehicles in Traffic](https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/mids-207-final-project-summer23-Nick-Frances-Jerry-Chi)**  
In this four-person project, we applied machine learning techniques to distinguish emergency vehicle sirens from regular road noise to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion.
