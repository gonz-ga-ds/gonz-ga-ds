    <h3>My Capstone Project</h3>
    <p class="left-aligned"><strong><a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2024/jeopardyllm-adventures-retrieval-augmented-generation">JeopardyLLM: Adventures in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</a></strong><br>
        I played a key role in a dynamic five-member team that revolutionized data engineering for Jeopardy trivia by implementing cutting-edge retrieval-augmented 
        generation technologies. Our project streamlined the integration of over 470,000 Jeopardy clues from 39 seasons into a powerful data processing system. 
        We crafted a sophisticated data modeling framework that efficiently transforms historical trivia into contextual data for our FLAN-T5 language model. 
        The result? The JeopardyLLM application‚Äîan innovative, interactive tool that allows users to delve into a vast database of historical clues and uncover answers. 
        This tool not only enhances the user experience but also boasts an acceptable 31.7% accuracy rate on challenging championship-level questions.</p>

    <h3>Computer Vision Project</h3>
    <p class="left-aligned">
        <strong>RealWaste: Trash, Compost, Recyclable Classification Solutions</strong><br>
        This project classifies waste images from the RealWaste Dataset, into three categories: Trash, Recyclable, and Compost.

    <h3>Experiments and causal Inference project</h3>
    <p class="left-aligned">
        <strong>Chess Banter: Does engaging with an opponent in online chess impact their performance?</strong><br>
        Bullying in online games is a serious problem and online chess is no exception. The purpose of trash talking is to try to decrease opponent performance by distracting opponents into heightened emotions and
        less logical decision making. This project posits that encountering a text designed to provoke a challenge from an opponent may create a sense of perceived rivalry, ultimately enhancing their gameplay accuracy and performance.
