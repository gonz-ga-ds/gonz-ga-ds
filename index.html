    <h3>My Capstone Project</h3>
    <p class="left-aligned"><strong><a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2024/jeopardyllm-adventures-retrieval-augmented-generation">JeopardyLLM: Adventures in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</a></strong><br>
    This project explores retrieval-augmented generation technologies by using questions found on the popular game show Jeopardy. Our data includes 470,000 Jeopardy clues from 39 seasons. Using this, we deployed a framework by which old clues are embedded and stored in a vector database, then contexts are created from novel questions and along with a prompt, fed to a FLAN-T5 large language model. This was successfully deployed as JeopardyLLM, an online interactive website where users can engage with and discover answers to questions based solely on knowledge gained from old Jeopardy clues. When measured on newer championship-level Jeopardy questions, accuracy was found to be 31.7%</p>

    <h3>Computer Vision Project</h3>
    <p class="left-aligned">
        <strong>RealWaste: Trash, Compost, Recyclable Classification Solutions</strong><br>
        This project classifies waste images from the RealWaste Dataset, into three categories: Trash, Recyclable, and Compost.

    <h3>Experiments and causal Inference project</h3>
    <p class="left-aligned">
        <strong>Chess Banter: Does engaging with an opponent in online chess impact their performance?</strong><br>
        Bullying in online games is a serious problem and online chess is no exception. The purpose of trash talking is to try to decrease opponent performance by distracting opponents into heightened emotions and
        less logical decision making. This project posits that encountering a text designed to provoke a challenge from an opponent may create a sense of perceived rivalry, ultimately enhancing their gameplay accuracy and performance.
